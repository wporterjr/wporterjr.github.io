The Miliage Adjuster App
========================================================

Modern technology has enabled increasing gas miliage in vehicles and more and more people are buying cars that get really good miliage.  However, it is a widely unknown fact that producing beef is a process that also consumes a lot of gas compared to other feed animals and crops.*  When you consume beef you are also using the gasoline that it took to produce it.

BurgerBurnin - how we do it
========================================================

This application will adjust your car's miliage based on your beef consumption.  It demonstrates that the amount of beef that you consume affects the ammount of gasoline that you use almost as much as what kind of car you drive.  It uses the widely accepted fact that it takes one gallon of gasoline to produce one pound of grain fed beef.*  It ignores the other main effects of beef production such as water use, methane (greenhouse gas) producion, land use, grain use, etc.  Other types of feed animals and animal derived products (milk, eggs, etc) use a fraction of the energy to farm compared to beef and are ignored in out application.

Examples
========================================================
Daryl drives a jacked up pickup truck ten miles to his favorite burger place, orders a salad, and drives back home.  His vehicle gets 15 mpg with no adjustment from his food.

Friedrich drives his hybrid compact car to the same establishment and orders a 1 pound mega burger.  Even though his car gets 45 mpg he burned an additional gallon by purchasing a large ammount of beef.  His adjusted miliage turns out to be just 8 mpg for the whole trip.

Way to save the planet Daryl!
